# Temporal patterns

## Overview
This software repository contains an experimental software implementation of algorithms for solving a set of restless reachability problems in temporal graphs. The software is written in C programming language.

This version of the source code is realeased for WSDM - 2021 submission titled "Restless reachability in temporal graphs: algebraic methods and applications".

## License
The source code is subject to MIT license.

## Compilation
The source code is configured for a gcc build. Other builds are possible but it might require manual configuration of the 'Makefile'.

Use GNU make to build the software. Check 'Makefile' for more details.

`make clean all`

## Using the software
